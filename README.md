Hourglass
=========

iOS library for testing if a time interval is elapsed.

## Overview

There are two different hourglasses:

- _Hourglass_ is a collection of [dispatch](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/Reference/reference.html)-like functions
- _ACHourglass_ is class where you can set a time interval for a named condition and later check if enough time has passed for that condition.

The two are a little bit different and their usage. See documentation and headers for more.
